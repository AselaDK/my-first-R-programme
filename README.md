The Excersice


1. Make script called  “firstProgramme”. When run, the script should display the following text: 
Hello World! I am going to learn OCTAVE! 
 
2. Make script called “secondProgramme”. Save the following scalar variables to the file that you created.  a. A  = 105 b. B = 9.5 x 1035 c. C = 7 + 5i d. D = 4 – 2i e. E = C – D    Clear all environment variables from the work space.  Then load all the variables to the workspace and check whether those variables are loading to the workspace or not. 
 
3. Vector variables. Append the following variables to the above file. 
 
a. aVec = [5.3 3.4 6 23] 
 
b. bVec = 
     
      100 6 3.5 5.3
  
 
c. cVec = [5 4.5 4 … -4.5 -5] (all the numbers from 5 to -5 in increments of -0.5)  
 
d. dVec = University of Colombo School of Computing (dVec is a string, which is a vector of characters) 
 
 
4. Plot a sine wave and a cosine wave over one period 
Make a time vector t from 0 to 2 π with enough samples to get smooth lines 
plot(sin t) using a red dashed line and plot(cos t) using green dashed line 
i. Label the x axis using xlabel ii. Label the y-axis using ylabel iii. Give the figure a title using title iv. Create a legend to describe the two lines you have plotted by using legend and passing to it to the two strings „Sin‟ and „Cos‟
